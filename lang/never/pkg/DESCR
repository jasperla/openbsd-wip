Never is a simple functional programming language. Technically it may be
classified as syntactically scoped, strongly typed, call by value,
functional programming language.

In practice Never offers basic data types, assignment, control flow,
arrays, first order functions and some mathematical functions to make it
useful to calculate expressions. Also it demonstrates how functions can
be compiled, invoked and passed as parameters or results between other
functions.

Never code can be executed as a scripting language or embedded into C
code.
