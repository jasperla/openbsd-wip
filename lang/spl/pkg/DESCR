A programming language created with the design goal to make the
source code resemble Shakespeare plays.

The characters in the play are variables. If you want to assign a
character, let's say Hamlet, a negative value, you put him and
another character on the stage and let that character insult Hamlet.

Input and output is done be having someone tell a character to
listen their heart and speak their mind. The language contains
conditionals, where characters ask each other questions, and jumps,
where they decide to go to a specific act or scene. Characters are
also stacks that can be pushed and popped.
