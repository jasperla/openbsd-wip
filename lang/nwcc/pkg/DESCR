nwcc is a simple C compiler for Unix systems targeting a variety of
architectures. Full source code is freely available under the (revised)
BSD license.

Apart from full C89 support, nwcc also provides many C99 and GNU C
features, and can be used as a drop-in replacement for gcc in many
cases. Cross-compilation and PIC code for shared libraries are also
supported, albeit incompletely.

nwcc has been known to compile many small and medium sized open-source
applications correctly.

Development priorities have traditionally favored language feature
support, portability and compatibility. As a result, nwcc is completely
lacking in optimization and support for debugging or profiling.
