Io is a prototype-based programming language inspired by Smalltalk (all values
are objects, all messages are dynamic), Self (prototype-based), NewtonScript
(differential inheritance), Act1 (actors and futures for concurrency), LISP
(code is a runtime inspectable/modifiable tree) and Lua (small, embeddable).
