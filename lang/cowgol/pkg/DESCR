Cowgol is an experimental, Ada-inspired language for very small systems
(6502, Z80, etc). It's different because it's intended to be self-hosted
on these devices: the end goal is to be able to rebuild the entire
compiler on an 8-bit micro, although we're not there yet.

Features:
* Properly type safe, modern language inspired by Ada
* The compiler is written in itself and is fully bootstrapped
* Table-driven, easy to port backend
* Global analysis: dead code removal and static variable allocation

The following targets are supported:
* Z80 and 8080, on CP/M
* 6502 and 65c02, on the BBC Micro with Tube second processor
* 6303, on the 6303 version of Fuzix
* 6502 interpreted bytecode, on the BBC Micro with Tube second
  processor
* 8086, on DOS (it emits tiny mode .com files)
* PDP11, on V7 Unix
* Generic and terrible C
* Microsoft BASIC

Simple emulators for various 8-bit platforms are included.
