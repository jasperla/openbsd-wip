lci is a LOLCODE interpreter written in C and is designed to be correct,
portable, fast, and precisely documented.

* correct: Every effort has been made to test lci's conformance to the
      LOLCODE language specification. Unit tests come packaged with the
      lci source code.
* portable: lci follows the widely ported ANSI C specification allowing it
      to compile on a broad range of systems.
* fast: Much effort has gone into producing simple and efficient code
      whenever possible to the extent that the above points are not
      compromized.
* precisely documented: lci uses Doxygen to generate literate code
      documentation.
