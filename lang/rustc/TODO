Packaging
---------
- bootstrap: need to have a really static bootstrapper
- check if -Wl,--as-needed is ok (has been removed at initial bootstrapping from linux)
	https://github.com/semarie/rust/commit/03cf086c07824e2cb1244dda98ef64cb8de983af

- python module
   lib/rustlib/etc/gdb_load_rust_pretty_printers.py
   lib/rustlib/etc/gdb_rust_pretty_printing.py

- manpage path under ${PREFIX}/man/

- install
  - move lib to lib/rustc ?
  - keep extrafilename ? (libs are like lib/libarena-4e7c5e5c.so)
  - provide a rustc shell script as wrapper
    it is need due to us poor load_self implementation (realpath(argv[0])).
    rustc normally use it for infer the default sysroot.
    but when started from PATH, argv[0] = "rustc", so no sysroot, so panic.

- clean ${BUILDDIR}/config.mk for not needed program ? (git, curl, ...)

- see any others TODO in Makefile


Bugs
----
- provide a complete load_self function (src/libstd/sys/unix/os.rs)
  - need for backtrace support (read the symbols from executable file)
  - need for rustc --sysroot default value (infer rustlib from rustc location)

- stack-overflow not detected
  see tests/run-pass/out-of-stack.rs
  IRC: eddyb: (guard page) it's not platform dependent, and it's in something called by whatever #[lang="start"] is now
              it may be std::rt now

Tests failures
--------------
  * stack-overflow detection
    [run-pass] run-pass/out-of-stack.rs
      the test check if stack-overflow are detected.

  * os::self_exe_name badly implemented
    [run-pass] run-pass/backtrace.rs
      for correctly show the backtrace, libbacktrace *must* read executable file, and so find it

    [run-pass] run-pass/issue-15149.rs
    [run-pass] run-pass/issue-16272.rs
    [run-pass] run-pass/issue-20091.rs
    [run-pass] run-pass/process-spawn-with-unicode-params.rs
      suppose os::self_exe_name always return something... fail

  * [run-pass] run-pass/tcp-stress.rs
      "Too many open files"
