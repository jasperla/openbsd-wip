Packaging
---------
- bootstrap: need to have a really static bootstrapper

- install
  - keep extrafilename ? (libs are like lib/libarena-4e7c5e5c.so)
      it is used for ABI
      the use of SHARED_LIBS in ports should superseed it (we have MAJOR/MINOR)
  - rustdoc need to known sysroot, but don't have any option to pass it
      if you want use it, you should pass the complete path
      (invoke it like: $ /usr/local/bin/rustdoc bla-bla)
  - rust-gdb is a shell script that require a more recent gdb than base

- see any others TODO in Makefile


Bugs
----
- provide a complete current_exe function (src/libstd/sys/unix/os.rs)
  - need for backtrace support (read the symbols from executable file)
  - need for rustc --sysroot default value (infer rustlib from rustc location)


Tests failures
--------------
  * [run-pass] run-pass/tcp-stress.rs
      intermittent failure
      "Too many open files"
      => may be be a problem in compiletest, as the test is ok when run manually.
      NOTE: the test is disabled

  * [debuginfo-gdb] all the testsuite
	seems that gdb in base don't do what expected here
