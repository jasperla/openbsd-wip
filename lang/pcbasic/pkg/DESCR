PC-BASIC is a free, cross-platform interpreter for GW-BASIC, Advanced
BASIC (BASICA), PCjr Cartridge Basic and Tandy 1000 GWBASIC. It
interprets these BASIC dialects with a high degree of accuracy, aiming
for bug-for-bug compatibility. PC-BASIC emulates the most common video
and audio hardware on which these BASICs used to run. PC-BASIC runs
plain-text, tokenised and protected .BAS files. It implements
floating-point arithmetic in the Microsoft Binary Format (MBF) and can
therefore read and write binary data files created by GW-BASIC.
