Known issues
============

- Racket and Scribble crash with a segfault in some specific situations due to
  the limits imposed by OpenBSD. If this happens, check the limits of the shell
  and login.conf.

- Some examples of ffi-lib doesn't work.

- Due to lack of thread-local storage support on OpenBSD, "places" and
  "futures" are disabled.

Limitations
===========

Racket only supports CPUs with SSE extension.
