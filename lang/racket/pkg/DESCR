Racket (formerly called PLT Scheme) is a multi-paradigm programming 
language in the Lisp/Scheme family, that also serves as a platform for 
language creation, design, and implementation. The Racket platform has
four primary components:
- the implementation of Racket (including a rich run-time system, 
  various libraries, JIT compiler, and more);
- DrRacket (formerly named DrScheme), the Racket program development
  environment;
- the ProgramByDesign outreach, an attempt to turn computing and
  programming into "an indispensable part of the liberal arts 
  curriculum";
- PLaneT, Racket's web-based package distribution system for
  user-contributed packages;
