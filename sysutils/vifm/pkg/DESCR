Vifm is a two panel ncurses based vi[m] like file manager. If you use vi,
vifm gives you complete keyboard control over your files without having
to learn a new set of commands. It goes not just about vi[m] like
keybindings, but also about modes, options, registers, commands and other
things you might already like in vi[m].
