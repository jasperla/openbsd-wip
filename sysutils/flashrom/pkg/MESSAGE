This software requires access to /dev/mem, your system's physical memory.
This has an impact on system security, and is not done by default.

To grant this permission, boot in single-user mode, or temporarily set
sysctl kern.securelevel=-1 in /etc/rc.securelevel.

To revoke this permission after use, revert rc.securelevel to its
previous setting, and set sysctl kern.securelevel=1 to have it take
effect immediately.
