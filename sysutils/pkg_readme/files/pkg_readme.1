.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_readme
.Nd list and display readme files for packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Bk -words
.Op Ar number

.Nm
.Bk -words
.Ar pkg-name
.Op Ar ...

.Sh DESCRIPTION
When run without arguments,
.Nm
will list all available readme files for installed packages together
with time stamps of last modification, sorted by timestamp.
.Pp
If single argument is given, and it's a non-negative
.Ar number ,
then
.Nm
will show last
.Ar number
installed or updated readme files.
.Pp
Otherwise, all arguments will be treated as a list of package names
and/or their stems, and
.Nm
will try to find and display readme files for matching packages.
Package name matching is partial, so both
.Ar postgresql-server
and
.Ar postgresql
will match
.Ar postgresql-server-9.2.1
package.
.Pp
.Nm
does not look into packages repository itself.
Thus
.Nm
can misbehave if packages are being installed, updated or removed while
it is running.
