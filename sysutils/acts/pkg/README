Script locations
================
The ACTS script is installed in ${PREFIX}/libexec/acts, with pre and
post execution script examples located in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/acts.
If you use them, you may deploy them to ${PREFIX}/libexec or any other
convenient location.

Provisioning
============
The ${SYSCONFDIR}/acts.conf file should be modified to fit your
execution requirements.  ACTS is normally executed by cron(8), either
by provisioning an appropriate crontab(8) or by adding it to daily(8)
tasks in /etc/daily.local.
