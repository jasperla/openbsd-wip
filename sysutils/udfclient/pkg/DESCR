UDFclient is a userland implementation of the UDF filingsystem as
defined by the OSTA group. UDFclient is designed to be a study platform
and a run-up to a full read and write kernel level implementation.

UDFclient basicly provides a userinterface not unlike ftp(1) but differs
in that it allways fetches or writes files recursively from the disc(s).
As from version 0.4.9 it supports the basic get, mget, put, mput, mv,
rm, mkdir, cd, lcd, free, pwd, lls command set. get and put can now also
retrieve or store using different names than the origional.
