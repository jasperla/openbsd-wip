$OpenBSD:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Installed
=========

cd_disect	Display SCSI / ATAPI device information.  Untested.

cd_sessions	Optical device session management.  Untested.

mmc_format	Format optical media.  Untested.

newfs_udf	Format a filesystem

udfclient	Read or write to a filesystem

udfdump		Display contents of filesystem

Issuing any command without options will produce a list of
options.

Considerations
==============

Interoperability with mount_udf(8)
----------------------------------
This requires a 2048-byte block size, as mount_udf() is intended
for use with optical drives.  Such filesystems are
unlikely to be interoperable with other OSes unless placed on
optical media.  Other blocksizes (such as 512 or 4096-byte, used with disk drives)
will not be mountable.

Use use a 2048 byte blocksize 
when formatting a filesystem, and explicitly with udfclient
in order to be ale to use mount_udf().  

UDF root directory
------------------

The UDF root directory is named with colon separated strings.

  "<volume set>:<primary volume>:<logical volume>:<additional tag>"

The udfclient requires a 'cd' into this root directory before you can 
read or write files and directories.

udfclient interactive commands
------------------------------

These are ftp-like, with some differences.  Use the 'help' command at
the "UDF>" prompt to display a short summary of them.

Of particular value is a 'get' or 'put' of a directory.  This will 
copy the entire structure in or out of the filesystem.

Example
=======

$ cd /tmp
$ mkdir test.directory
$ touch test.directory/{a,b,c,d}
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test.iso bs=10m count=10
$ newfs_udf -S test -P test -L test test.iso
$ udfclient -W test.iso
