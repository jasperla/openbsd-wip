Utilities
=========

cd_disect       Display SCSI / ATAPI device information
cd_sessions     Optical device session management
mmc_format      Format optical media
newfs_udf       Format a filesystem
udfclient       Read or write to a filesystem
udfdump         Display contents of a filesystem

Issuing any command without options will produce a usage summary.

Considerations
==============

Special files and links
-----------------------

* All links will be followed and files replicated when copied to
  a UDF filesystem, whether hard or symbolic links.

* Block, character, FIFO, and socket special files are not
  supported.

UDF on disk drives
------------------

Disklabels are not used, except for virtual disklabel "a" with
2048-byte blocksize devices.  MBRs are not used, the filesystem
begins at LBA 0.  Partition "c" should be used if writing directly
to a drive instead of an image file.  If the drive contains prior
data, zero the leading sectors before use as shown in the first
command below.
 
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd9c count=63
# newfs_udf -L shared.drive /dev/rsd9c
# ufsclient -W /dev/rsd9c

Interoperability with mount_udf(8)
----------------------------------

Kernel recognition (virtual partition "a") and mounting r/o with
mount_udf() requires a 2048-byte logial block size, to map a
filesystem image to an optical drive's sector size.

This precludes direct use with sd(4) devices, and may prevent
interoperability with other OSes unless the image is transferred
to optical media, as a logical block size must map to the physical
sector size per the OSTA specification for UDF.

Use '-b 2048' with newfs_udf when formatting these image files
and with udfclient when writing these image files.

UDF root directory
------------------

The UDF root directory is named with colon separated strings.

  "<volume set>:<primary volume>:<logical volume>:<additional tag>"

The udfclient requires a 'cd' into this root directory before you can
read or write files and directories. Spaces will require quoting the
string between " " characters.

udfclient interactive commands
------------------------------

These are ftp-like, with some differences.  Use the 'help' command at
the "UDF>" prompt to display a summary.

Of particular value is a 'get' or 'put' of a directory.  This will copy
the entire structure in or out of the filesystem.

Example
=======

$ cd /tmp
$ mkdir test.directory
$ touch test.directory/{a,b,c,d}
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test.iso bs=10m count=10
$ newfs_udf -S test -P test -L test test.iso
$ udfclient -W test.iso
