 * Veirfy rc script. **
 * Figure out whether package is needed (some syncthing addons may use it?)

** I have been using a slightly different version of this rc script for a while.
No issues so far. Not sure on the use of _syncthing as the daemon user. I
believe most people will want to specify the user it runs as.
