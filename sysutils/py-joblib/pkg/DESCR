Joblib is a set of tools to provide lightweight pipelining in Python.
In particular:

    transparent disk-caching of functions and lazy re-evaluation
    (memoize pattern)

    easy simple parallel computing

Joblib is optimized to be fast and robust in particular on large
data and has specific optimizations for numpy arrays. It is
BSD-licensed.
