The Tarsnap frontend is an open source cross-platform Graphical User Interface
for the popular Tarsnap backup service, that's easy to use, light and open as
the Tarsnap command line client itself.

While the original Tarsnap command line client is oriented towards server and
scripted backups, facilitating workflows from inside a terminal, the GUI
frontend application allows the desktop user to easily back up important files
and directories using a lean and no-fuss interface while benefiting from the
same power, flexibility, openness and cost effectiveness that the Tarsnap
service implies and provides.
