| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although dinit can be used to boot a Linux system from scratch, you cannot use
dinit as a replacement for OpenBSD's init system. This package does however
allow you to use dinit as a generic process supervisor on OpenBSD.

Getting Started Guide
=====================

The best way to get up an running quickly with Dinit is to read the getting
started guide:

 $ less ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/doc/dinit/getting_started.md

Running System-wide
===================

The provided rc script starts a system-wide instance of dinit. The instance
will run as root so that services requiring root permissions can be managed
under dinit. If your services don't need root permissions, then you should run
dinit as a normal user instead.

When running a system-wide instance, add `-s` to your dinitctl(8) invocations.
