"Dinit" is a service supervisor with dependency support.

Specifically, Dinit can launch multiple services in parallel, with dependency
management (i.e. if one service's operation depends on another, the latter
service will be started first). It can monitor the process corresponding to a
service, and re-start it if it dies, and it can do this in an intelligent way,
first "rolling back" all dependent services, and restarting them when their
dependencies are satisfied. However, the precise nature of dependency relations
between services is highly configurable.
