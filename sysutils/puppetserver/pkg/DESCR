Puppet Server is the next-generation application for managing Puppet
agents. It is the platform that will carry Puppet's server-side
components to a more distributed, service-oriented architecture. It has
been built on top of the same technologies that have made PuppetDB
successful, and will allow us to make great leaps forward in
performance, scalability, advanced metrics collection, and fine-grained
control over the Ruby runtime.
