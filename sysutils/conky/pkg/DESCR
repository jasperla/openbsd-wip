Conky is a system monitor for X originally based on the torsmo code.
Since it's original conception, Conky has changed a fair bit from it's
predecessor. Conky can display just about anything, either on your root
desktop or in it's own window. Conky has many built-in objects, as well
as the ability to execute programs and scripts, then display the output
from stdout.
