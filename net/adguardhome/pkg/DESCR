AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads & tracking. After you
set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any
client-side software for that.

It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a "black hole,"
thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers. It's based on
software we use for our public AdGuard DNS servers -- both share a lot of
common code.
