ddgr is a command line utility to search DuckDuckGo from the terminal.

Unlike the web interface, you can specify the number of search results
you would like to see per page. It's more convenient than skimming
through 30-odd search results per page. The default interface is
carefully designed to use minimum space without sacrificing readability.

ddgr works over the Tor network.
