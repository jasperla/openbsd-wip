A pure Python network address representation and manipulation library.

netaddr provides a Pythonic way of working with:

- IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and subnets
- MAC addresses, OUI and IAB identifiers, IEEE EUI-64 identifiers
- arbitrary (non-aligned) IP address ranges and IP address sets
- various non-CIDR IP range formats such as nmap and glob-style formats

Included are routines for:

- generating, sorting and summarizing IP addresses and networks
- performing easy conversions between address notations and formats
- detecting, parsing and formatting network address representations
- performing set-based operations on groups of IP addresses and subnets
- working with arbitrary IP address ranges and formats
- accessing OUI and IAB organisational information published by IEEE
- accessing IP address and block information published by IANA.
