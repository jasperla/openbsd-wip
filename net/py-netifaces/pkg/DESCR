It’s been annoying me for some time that there’s no easy way
to get the address(es) of the machine’s network interfaces from
Python. There is a good reason for this difficulty, which is that
it is virtually impossible to do so in a portable manner. However,
it seems to me that there should be a package you can easy_install
that will take care of working out the details of doing so on the
machine you’re using, then you can get on with writing Python code
without concerning yourself with the nitty gritty of system-dependent
low-level networking APIs.

This package attempts to solve that problem.
