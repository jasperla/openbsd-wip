horst is a small, lightweight IEEE802.11 WLAN analyzer with a text
interface. Its basic function is similar to tcpdump, Wireshark
or Kismet, but it's much smaller and shows different, aggregated
information which is not easily available from other tools.

It is made for debugging wireless LANs with a focus on getting a quick
overview instead of deep packet inspection and has special features
for Ad-hoc (IBSS) mode and mesh networks. It can be useful to get a
quick overview of what's occurring on all wireless LAN channels and to
identify problems.

Note: it is only partially working on OpenBSD. Some features are not
available as they use Linux 802.11 control methods (including scanning
multiple channels), some display incorrect information (bytes per
packet calculations come up with bogus answers), and it's unable to
see frames with channel widths not available in OpenBSD. Nevertheless
it still has some uses.
