Quassel IRC is a modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client,
meaning that one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach
from a central core -- much like the popular combination of screen
and a text-based IRC client such as WeeChat, but graphical. In
addition to this unique feature, we aim to bring a pleasurable,
comfortable chatting experience to all major platforms (including
Linux, Windows, and MacOS as well as Android smartphones),
making communication with your peers not only convenient, but also
ubiquitous available.

This package contains the monolithic client.
