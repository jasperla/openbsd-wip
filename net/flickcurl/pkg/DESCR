Flickcurl is a C library (and utility) for the Flickr API, handling
creating the requests, signing, token management, calling the API,
marshalling request parameters and decoding responses.

It uses libcurl to call the REST web service and libxml2 to manipulate
the XML responses. Flickcurl 1.0 or later supports 100% of the
2008-04-07 version of the API (see Flickcurl API coverage) including the
functions for photo/video uploading, browsing, searching, adding and
editing comments, groups, notes, photosets, categories, activity, blogs,
favorites, places, tags and photo, video metadata.

It also includes a program flickrdf to turn photo metadata, tags,
machine tags and places into an RDF triples description.
