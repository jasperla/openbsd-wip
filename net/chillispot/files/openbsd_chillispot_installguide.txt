You'll need a minimum of 2 interfaces to get up & running.
The external interface needs to be setup with the relevant info (ip address, etc etc)
The internal interface (or the interface chillispot is running on) doesn't need any setting applied 
apart from that it needs to be marked up & if its a wireless card it needs to be set to hostap mode & 
have a ssid assigned.

PF needs to be enabled aswell as the net.inet.ip.forwarding sysctl.
You'll also need to setup a SSL certificate for Apache to use & start it without chroot.

Everything you need to get started is in {PREFIX}/share/doc/chillispot
You'll need to install a RADIUS server if you don't have one setup already.

Copy hotspotlogin.cgi from {PREFIX}/share/chillispot to your cgi-bin directory
Copy chillispot-pf.conf to /etc/pf.conf & edit the int & ext_if macros 
if you're using freeRADIUS  there is a sample dictionary file included which needs to be added 
to your master dictionary file.
Copy chilli.conf & chilli.ipup from {PREFIX}/share/chillispot to /etc
& edit the dns, dhcpif, uamsecret & radiussecret options in chilli.conf & make chilli.ip executable.

Now edit the hotspotlogin.cgi file you copied to your cgi-bin directory earlier & uncomment and change
uamsecret so that its the same as the entry in your /etc/chilli.conf, then make it executable.

Now start chillispot in debug mode & make sure your clients are able to connect & chillispot is responding by issuing
chilli -fd 

If everything is working as it should add the following to your /etc/rc.local
if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/chilli ]; then
/usr/local/bin/chilli > /dev/null & echo -n ' chillispot'
fi
