This is for CI testing of transmission developer tearfur's fork of transmission.
Changes are expected to eventually merge, or his project will publish.

1) git clone -b obsd --recurse-submodules \
       git@github.com:jggimi/tearfur-transmission.git 
       transmission-4.1.0.dev

   This fork is manually synced, the branch adds an ./archive.sh script
   to simplify distfile creation.

2) create tarball, xz compress it, move to distfiles. 

   `sh archive.sh`  will create a git archive tarball with all source submodules,
   compress it, and move it into /usr/ports/distfiles.

3) make uninstall

4) make clean=all, makesum, (patch, update-patches), update-plist, port-lib-depends-check, install-all
5) make test, there should be zero failures
6) test the installed application suite


optional) if you want the shadow symbol packages installed, make with DEBUG=-g,
          the Makefile contains:
          
		.if DEBUG
		CONFIGURE_ARGS +=	-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
		INSTALL_DEBUG_PACKAGES=	Yes
		.endif
