# The old ipython-0.11 port installed share/examples/ipython as a regular

# tools that prevents files from being replaced by directories during an
# upgrade, we must install the examples elsewhere to avoid the clash.
# Once the pkg tools bug is fixed, we can use the normal examples path
# (currently commented). Also be sure to update the setupbase.py patch.
