Spyder is an interactive Python development environment providing MATLAB-like
features in a simple and light-weighted software. It also provides ready-to-use
pure-Python widgets to your PyQt5 or PyQt4 application: source code editor with
syntax highlighting and code introspection/analysis features, NumPy array
editor, dictionary editor, Python console, etc.
