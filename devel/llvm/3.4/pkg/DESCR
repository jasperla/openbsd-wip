The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler
and toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to
do with traditional virtual machines, though it does provide helpful
libraries that can be used to build them.

This package includes the LLVM Core and the Clang compiler suite.

The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent
optimizer, along with code generation support for various popular CPUs
(i386, amd64, powerpc and arm are major targets). These libraries are
built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM
intermediate representation ("LLVM IR"). The LLVM Core libraries are
well documented, and it is particularly easy to invent your own language
(or port an existing compiler) to use LLVM as an optimizer and code
generator.

Clang is an "LLVM native" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims
to deliver fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages
and to provide a platform for building great source level tools.
The Clang Static Analyzer is a tool automatically finds bugs in
your code, and is a great example of the sort of tool that can be
built using the Clang frontend as a library to parse C/C++ code.
