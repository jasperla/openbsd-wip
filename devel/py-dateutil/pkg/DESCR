The dateutil module provides powerful extensions to the standard
datetime module, available in Python 2.3+. It features computing of
relative deltas (next month, next year, next Monday, last week of month,
etc), computing of dates based on very flexible recurrence rules, using
a superset of the iCalendar specification and generic parsing of dates
in almost any string format.
