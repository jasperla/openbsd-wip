This module works around two historical bugs in Perl's handling of the
%^H (lexical hints) variable. One bug causes lexical state in one file
to leak into another that is required/used from it. This bug, [perl
#68590], was present from Perl 5.6 up to Perl 5.10, fixed in Perl
5.11.0. The second bug causes lexical state (normally a blank %^H once
the first bug is fixed) to leak outwards from utf8.pm, if it is
automatically loaded during Unicode regular expression matching, into
whatever source is compiling at the time of the regexp match. This bug,
[perl #73174], was present from Perl 5.8.7 up to Perl 5.11.5, fixed in
Perl 5.12.0.
