Update p5-Package-Stash to version 0.33, which will utilize
p5-Package-Stash-XS if available.  Remove USE_GROFF.

Changes since version 0.05:

0.33  2011-09-28
      - add conflict on MooseX::Method::Signatures 0.36 (ether)

0.32  2011-09-05
      - bring the behavior of has_symbol for nonexistant scalars into line with
        the xs version
      - invalid package names (for instance, Foo:Bar) are not allowed
      - invalid stash entry names (anything containing ::) are not allowed

0.31  2011-08-08
      - fix ->add_symbol('$foo', qr/sdlfk/) on 5.12+
      - fix ->add_symbol('$foo', \v1.2.3) on 5.10+

0.30  2011-07-21
      - fix compiler detection in Makefile.PL (ribasushi)

0.29  2011-04-06
      - no, *really* skip the package-stash-conflict script

0.28  2011-03-29
      - META.json fixes (mst)

0.27  2011-03-27
      - also skip the package-stash-conflicts script (Father Chrysostomos)

0.26  2011-03-04
      - make the namespace cache lazy and weak, in case the stash is deleted
      - but, this doesn't work on 5.8, so disable the namespace caching
        entirely there

0.25  2011-01-25
      - make the leak tests author-only, since some smokers run release tests

0.24  2011-01-17
      - oops, i did need the Test::Requires dep

0.23  2011-01-11
      - lower perl prereq to 5.8.1 (ribasushi)
      - make the leak tests release-only, since they keep randomly failing on
        platforms i don't have access to. people are encouraged to submit
        patches for these if they are affected.

0.22  2011-01-05
      - bump ::XS dep again

0.21  2011-01-05
      - bump Package::Stash::XS dep, since a bug was fixed there

0.20  2011-01-03
      - one more fix for the Conflicts plugin

0.19  2011-01-03
      - stop manually inserting conflict checking into Makefile.PL since we're
        using the dzil Conflicts plugin now

0.18  2011-01-03
      - non-trial release

0.17-TRIAL  2011-01-03
      - use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Conflicts rather than doing it by hand
      - silence deprecation warnings for the method renaming for now

0.16-TRIAL  2010-12-31
      - use Dist::CheckConflicts

0.15-TRIAL  2010-11-16
      - split the XS conversion out to its own dist (Package-Stash-XS), and
        convert Package::Stash into a module which loads either the XS or pure
        perl implementation, depending on what's available

0.14-TRIAL  2010-11-14
      - complete rewrite in C, for speed (this includes the vivification
        changes from earlier). should be entirely backwards compatible
        otherwise (in terms of documented api anyway).

      - methods were renamed for brevity: s/_package//

0.13  2010-10-31
      - revert the vivification changes for now, to get an actual release out
        with Test::Fatal

0.12-TRIAL  2010-10-27
      - actually include the conflict stuff in the release (bah)

0.11-TRIAL  2010-10-27
      - conflict on mx-role-withoverloading too

0.10-TRIAL  2010-10-27
      - only do the weird ISA special-casing on perl versions where it's broken

0.09-TRIAL  2010-10-27
      - clean up the vivication code a lot, make it behave more sanely
      - use Test::Fatal instead of Test::Exception (Justin Hunter)

0.08  2010-09-18
      - oops, accidentally included some experimental changes in that last
        release, that break things

0.07  2010-09-18
      - non-dev release

0.06-TRIAL  2010-08-26
      - re-enable the caching of the stash, since I can't reproduce the bug
        at all
