This utility is designed to write a Makefile for an extension module
from a Makefile.PL. It is based on the Makefile.SH model provided by
Andy Dougherty and the perl5-porters.

It splits the task of generating the Makefile into several subroutines
that can be individually overridden. Each subroutine returns the text it
wishes to have written to the Makefile.

As there are various Make programs with incompatible syntax, which use
operating system shells, again with incompatible syntax, it is important
for users of this module to know which flavour of Make a Makefile has
been written for so they'll use the correct one and won't have to face
the possibly bewildering errors resulting from using the wrong one.
