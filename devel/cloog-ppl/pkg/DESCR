CLooG is a free software and library to generate code for scanning
Z-polyhedra. That is, it finds a code (e.g. in C, FORTRAN...) that
reaches each integral point of one or more parameterized polyhedra.
CLooG has been originally written to solve the code generation
problem for optimizing compilers based on the polytope model.
Nevertheless it is used now in various area e.g. to build control
automata for high-level synthesis or to find the best polynomial
approximation of a function. CLooG may help in any situation where
scanning polyhedra matters. While the user has full control on
generated code quality, CLooG is designed to avoid control overhead
and to produce a very effective code.
