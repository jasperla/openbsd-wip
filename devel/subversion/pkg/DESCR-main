Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as an
open-source, centralized version control system characterized by its
reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of its
model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide variety
of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale enterprise
operations.

Note that you need to install the following subpackages to gain the
appropriate functionality:
        -perl           Perl bindings to Subversion
        -python         Python bindings to Subversion
        -ruby           Ruby bindings to Subversion
        -ap2            Apache httpd 2 modules for Subversion
        -gnome-keyring  Store Subversion passwords in gnome-keyring

Also note that plaintext-password caching is disabled by default by
setting "store-plaintext-passwords" to "no" in ${SYSCONFDIR}/subversion/servers.
This is a different default behaviour to a standard Subversion install,
which would ask the user before storing passwords in plaintext.
