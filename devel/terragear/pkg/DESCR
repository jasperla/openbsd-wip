TerraGear is a collection of tools for building scenery for the
FlightGear project.  Generally, the process is done in two steps:

  1. Preprocess the original raw data.  This chops up the data into
     the FG tiling scheme and saves it in a simple, intermediate
     format.

  2. Collect all the different pieces of intermediate data and
     assemble them into a 3d model of the terrain.

There is currently no graphical front end for these tools so you will
need to run them from the command line.  Be prepaired, when building
scenery on a world wide scale, be prepaired to burn through multiple
gigabytes of disk space and days or weeks of crunching.  Building
smaller chunks is much more doable though.
