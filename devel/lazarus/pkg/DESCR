Lazarus is a Rapid Application Development Tool for Free Pascal.
It comes with the LCL - Lazarus component library, which contains
platform independent visual components like buttons, windows,
checkbox, treeview and many, many more. The LCL is platform
independent, so you can write an application once and then compile
for various platforms without changing code.
