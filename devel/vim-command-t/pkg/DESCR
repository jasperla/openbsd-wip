The Command-T plug-in for VIM provides an extremely fast, intuitive
mechanism for opening files with a minimal number of keystrokes. It's
named "Command-T" because it is inspired by the "Go to File" window
bound to Command-T in TextMate.

Files are selected by typing characters that appear in their paths, and
are ordered by an algorithm which knows that characters that appear in
certain locations (for example, immediately after a path separator)
should be given more weight.
