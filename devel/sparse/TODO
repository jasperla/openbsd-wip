as noted by sthen:

The tough one - this is rather unfortunate:

./lib.c:static const char *gcc_base_dir = GCC_BASE;

GCC_BASE = $(shell $(CC) --print-file-name=)

.. because it will need bumping at release time, but it doesn't
make it anywhere that would trigger PLIST_DB into noticing.
Not sure the best way to handle this..
