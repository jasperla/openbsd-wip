Sonnet is a plugin-based spell checking library for Qt-based
applications. It supports several different plugins, including
HSpell, Enchant, ASpell and HUNSPELL.

It also supports automated language detection, based on a
combination of different algorithms.

The simplest way to use Sonnet in your application is to use the
SpellCheckDecorator class on your QTextEdit.
