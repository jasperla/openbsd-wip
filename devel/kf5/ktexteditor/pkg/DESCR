KTextEditor provides a powerful text editor component that you can embed in your
application, either as a KPart or using the KF5::TextEditor library (if you need
more control).

The text editor component contains many useful features, from syntax
highlighting and automatic indentation to advanced scripting support, making it
suitable for everything from a simple embedded text-file editor to an advanced
IDE.
