This framework contains scripts and data for building KDE API
documentation (dox) in a standard format and style.

The Doxygen tool is used to do the actual documentation extraction and
formatting, but this framework provides a wrapper script to make generating
the documentation more convenient (including reading settings from the target
framework or other module) and a standard template for the generated
documentation.
