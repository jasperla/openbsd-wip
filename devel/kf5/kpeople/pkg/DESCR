KPeople offers unified access to our contacts from different sources, grouping
them by person while still exposing all the data.

Furthermore, KPeople will also provide facilities to integrate the data provided
in user interfaces by providing QML and Qt Widgets components.

The sources are plugin-based, allowing to easily extend the contacts collection.
