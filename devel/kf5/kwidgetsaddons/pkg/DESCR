This repository contains add-on widgets and classes for applications
that use the Qt Widgets module. If you are porting applications from
KDE Platform 4 "kdeui" library, you will find many of its classes here.

Provided are action classes that can be added to toolbars or menus,
a wide range of widgets for selecting characters, fonts, colors,
actions, dates and times, or MIME types, as well as platform-aware
dialogs for configuration pages, message boxes, and password requests.

Further widgets and classes can be found in other KDE frameworks. For
a full list, please see https://projects.kde.org/projects/frameworks/.
