This library contains classes to improve the handling of icons
in applications using the KDE Frameworks. Provided are:

- KIconDialog: Dialog class to let the user select an icon
    from the list of installed icons.
- KIconButton: Custom button class that displays an icon.
    When clicking it, the user can change it using the icon dialog.
- KIconEffect: Applies various colorization effects to icons,
    which can be used to create selected/disabled icon images.

Other classes in this repository are used internally by the icon
theme configuration dialogs, and should not be used by applications.
