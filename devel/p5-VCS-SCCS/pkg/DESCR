SCCS (Source Code Control System) is a historical and maybe even
obsolete VCS (Version Control System).

This interface aims at the possibility to read those files,
without the need of the sccs utility set, and open up to the
possibility of scripts that use it to convert to more modern
VCSs like git, Mercurial, or subversion.
