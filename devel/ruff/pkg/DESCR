ruff is an extremely fast Python linter, written in Rust.

Features:
  - 10-100x faster than existing linters
  - pyproject.toml support
  - Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
  - Autofix support, for automatic error correction (e.g., automatically
    remove unused imports)
  - Near-parity with the built-in Flake8 rule set
  - Native re-implementations of popular Flake8 plugins, like
    flake8-bugbear
  - First-party editor integrations
  - Monorepo-friendly configuration via hierarchical and cascading settings
