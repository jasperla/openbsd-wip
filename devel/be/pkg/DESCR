Bugs Everywhere is a distributed bugtracker, designed to complement
distributed revision control systems. It works with Arch, Bazaar,
Darcs, Git, Mercurial, and Monotone at the moment, but is easily
extensible.  It can also function with no VCS at all.

The idea is to package the bug information with the source code,
so that bugs can be marked "fixed" in the branches that fix them.
So, instead of numbers, bugs have globally unique IDs.
