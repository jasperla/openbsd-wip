Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on
flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists,
designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive
objects or environments. 

Arduino can sense the environment by receiving input from a variety of
sensors and can affect its surroundings by controlling lights, motors,
and other actuators. The microcontroller on the board is programmed
using the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring) and the Arduino
development environment (based on Processing). Arduino projects can be
stand-alone or they can communicate with software running on a computer
(e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP).

This package contains the libraries, header files and tools to develop
Arduino sketches. It does not include the Arduino IDE frontend.
