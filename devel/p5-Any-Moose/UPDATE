Update devel/p5-Any-Moose to version 0.18 and devel/p5-Mouse to version
0.97.  p5-Mouse now provides Mouse::XS, which is about 2 times faster
than Mouse::PurePerl.  Remove USE_GROFF.

Changes since version 0.09 of Any::Moose:

0.18 2011-11-07
  * Try to cope with broken smokers better by recording a Moose
    prereq when it is used. (Chris Williams)
    - see https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=72043

0.17 2011-09-16
  * Better indicate that this module is dynamically configured.
    - fixes [rt.cpan.org #70996]

0.16 2011-09-15
  * If you have Moose installed you no longer get the Mouse dependency (rjbs, reported by andk)
     Any::Moose has long had both runtime and test support for Moose
     without Mouse, but the toolchain has not, until recently, been
     good enough to handle alternatives. This change is designed
     to affect very few people.
    - fixes [rt.cpan.org #70597]

0.15 2011-06-07
  * Standardize the tests' Mouse/Moose loading eval/skip code
    (Sartak, reported by Daniel Macks)
    - fixes [rt.cpan.org #68657]

0.14 2011-04-29
  * Skip t/004-x-modules-mouse.t if you don't have MouseX::Types 0.03 since
    older versions do not work with modern Mouse (Sartak, reported by ewilhelm)

0.13  Wed 19 May 2010
  * Add load_first_existing_class (gfx)

0.12  Fri 02 Apr 2010
  * t/000-version.t for better diagnostics (tokuhirom)
  * Slight performance improvements for is_class_loaded,
      lazily loading Carp, etc (Sartak)
  * Start some real documentation (Sartak)
  * Document $ENV{ANY_MOOSE} (Sartak)
    - fixes [rt.cpan.org #52339]
  * Test that Moose is loaded, not CMOP (Sartak)
    - fixes [rt.cpan.org #56093]
  * Alias class_of and more functions (Sartak)
    - requested by [rt.cpan.org #52275]

0.11  Sun 19 Dec 2009
  * Support "use Any::Moose '::Util::TypeConstraints'" (gfx)
  * Support "no Any::Moose '::Util::TypeConstraints'" (gfx)
  * $@ related fixes (gfx)
  * Documentation and other minor improvements (gfx)
  * Any::Moose should now work when you have Moose but not Mouse. Still need to
    work out how to encode this in the installation system (Sartak)

0.10  Fri 19 Jun 2009
