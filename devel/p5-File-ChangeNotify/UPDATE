Update devel/p5-File-ChangeNotify to version 0.20.  Required by the update to
Moose 1.25.  License change from "same as perl" to Artistic 2.0.  Remove
USE_GROFF.

Changes since version 0.13:

0.20     2011-04-19

- The KQueue watcher checks that a file has a file descriptor to avoid
  watching closed files. Patch by Andreas Voegele.


0.19   2010-10-17

- The all.t test didn't run any tests at all if neither the Inotify nor KQueue
  watchers could be loaded. This was treated as a failure by test
  harnesses. Now we always test the Default class.


0.18   2010-10-15

- Always make a Default watcher object if we cannot load an OS-specific class.

- Add Test::Exception as a test prereq.


0.17   2010-10-04

- Loading File::ChangeNotify always loads the Default watcher class. This will
  give a useful error message if this module's prereqs are not loaded.


0.16   2010-07-12

- Changes to avoid a warning about a useless coercion from future versions of
  Moose.


0.15   2010-07-09

- Add a missing prereq, namespace::autoclean.


0.14   2010-07-08

- Running the tests left behind a lot of temp directories that should have
  been cleaned up, but weren't. Reported by Peter Edwards. RT #59125.

- License is now Artistic 2.0
