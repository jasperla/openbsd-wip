Update devel/p5-Package-Stash-XS to version 0.25.

Changes since version 0.22:

0.25  2011-09-06
      - fix compilation on perl 5.8 (RT#70762)

0.24  2011-09-05
      - invalid package names (for instance, Foo:Bar) are not allowed
      - invalid stash entry names (anything containing ::) are not allowed

0.23  2011-08-08
      - fix the test for scalar values, again (t0m, rafl)
      - disallow assigning globrefs to scalar glob slots (this doesn't actually
        make any sense)
