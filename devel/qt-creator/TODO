 * Verify that patch for src/shared/qbs/src/lib/corelib/tools/processutils.cpp
   does what it is supposed to do.
 * Even when the compiler for a Qt kit is set to eg++, Qt Creator compiles the
   code using g++...

Optional:
 * Do we want to auto-detect both Qt 5 and Qt 4? Currently, only one version
   is auto-detected and set up at a time.
 * Do we want to RUN_DEPENDS on lang/gcc/${MODGCC4_VERSION},-c++? Newer g++ is
   not required for compiling programs with Qt 5 but it might be a nice idea.
 * Add QTest::newRow() to abi.cpp?
