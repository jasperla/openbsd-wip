PyFilesystem is an abstraction layer for filesystems. In the same way that
Python's file-like objects provide a common way of accessing files,
PyFilesystem provides a common way of accessing entire filesystems. You can
write platform-independent code to work with local files, that also works
with any of the supported filesystems (zip, ftp, S3 etc.).
