Pylint is a lint-like tool for Python code. It performs almost all the
verifications that pychecker does, and additionally can perform some
stylistic verification and coding standard enforcements. The checked
code is assigned a mark based on the number and the severity of the
encountered problems. The previous mark of a given piece of code is
cached so that you can see if the code quality has improved since the
last check.
