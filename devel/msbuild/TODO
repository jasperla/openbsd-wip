make sure that internet is never connected to during build - how?

find: /usr/ports/pobj/msbuild-15.0pl20190314/msbuild-0.06/build/../artifacts/Release-MONO/packages: No such file or directory
- at the end of the build. Should be easy to patch out at bottom of build/build.sh

Double-check license

Warning: symlink(s) point to non-existent /usr/ports/pobj/msbuild-15.9.20/fake-amd64/usr/local/lib/mono/msbuild/Current/bin/Roslyn/System.Reflection.Metadata.dll
-> but symlink is relative and works in the install
/usr/ports/pobj/msbuild-15.9.20/fake-amd64/usr/local/share/man/man1/msbuild.1: No one-line description

May need to disable multicore builds somehow; see FreeBSD Makefile
- or disable concurrent builds

-lib/mono/xbuild/15.0/Imports/Microsoft.Common.props/ImportBefore/Microsoft.NuGet.ImportBefore.props
-> difference from canon

find a way to replace "15.0" in Makefile with a variable

make test depends on make build having run before
- how set this up in the Makefile of the port?

make test hangs on:
