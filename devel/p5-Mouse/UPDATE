Update devel/p5-Any-Moose to version 0.18 and devel/p5-Mouse to version
0.97.  p5-Mouse now provides Mouse::XS, which is about 2 times faster
than Mouse::PurePerl.  Remove USE_GROFF.

p5-Mouse is now SHARED_ONLY, which keeps the port simple.  p5-Any-Moose
and p5-Mouse are used by p5-Data-AMF and p5-GnuPG-Interface.
p5-Data-AMF depends on the SHARED_ONLY ports p5-DateTime and
p5-XML-LibXML anyway.  p5-GnuPG-Interface and gnupg aren't built on the
vax platform, so nothing is lost.

    [CHANGES]
    * Remove an optional depenency, Data::Util.
      This is used to make method modifiers faster, but the effect
      is limited to 'before' and 'after' modifiers. Rather,

      and sometimes the difference caused problems.

      'failed' twice in the same sentence. (Moose 1.05)

0.51 Mon Mar 15 15:25:58 2010
    SUMMARY

    [BUG FIXES]
    * Mouse::Object::DESTROY could cause SEGVs
    * Attribute triggers could cause panics
    * Integers > 2**32 were not groked as Int
    * Incorrect types, e.g. "Array[Int", was accepted
    * Metaclass compatibility was sometimes ignored

    [MOOSE COMPATIBILITY]
    * before/around/after accept regular expressions
    * has() becomes strict
    * the global destruction flag is passed to DEMOLISH methods
    * Delegations can be curried
    * Built-in type constraints have the same hierarchy as Moose's


0.50_09 Mon Mar 15 12:02:28 2010
    * (re)fix RT #55048 to grok 2**46+0.5 as Int, but
      accept 2**46 as Int even on 32 bit environments;
      note that an Int is exactly what is matched to /^[+-]?[0-9]+$/,
      so 10e100 will not be groked as Int (gfx)

0.50_08 Thu Mar 11 19:28:58 2010
    * Makefile.PL
        - Resolved #55419: Add Devel::PPPort to build_requires (gfx)
    * Mouse::Exporter
        - Turns on warnings FATAL => 'recursion' by default (gfx)
    * Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints
        - Change the type parser to check syntax (gfx)
          (Now it throws erros to "ArrayRef[]", "ArrayRef[Int", etc.)

0.50_05 Mon Mar  1 11:18:26 2010
    * Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints
        - Mouse used an incorrect cast at the C-level which meant that
          its idea of numbers was different from that of Perl's (and
          Mouse's). Notably > 2**32 Integers on 32 bit systems didn't
          work, RT #55048 (AEvar).
    * Mouse::Meta::Classs
        - Fix an issue on metaclass compatibility (gfx)

0.50_04 Fri Feb 26 18:57:24 2010

            'does', then it will be warned

    * Mouse::Object
