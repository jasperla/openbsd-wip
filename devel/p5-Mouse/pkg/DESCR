Moose is wonderful but unfortunately, a little slow.  Though significant
progress has been made over the years, the compile time penalty is a
non-starter for some applications.
Mouse aims to alleviate this by providing a subset of Moose's
functionality, faster.  In particular, "has" in Moose is missing only a
few expert-level features.
