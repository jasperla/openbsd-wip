Update devel/p5-Moose to version 1.25, which fixes a bug that accidentally
cleared out a role's stash in some circumstances.

p5-Task-Weaken is a build dependency and not a runtime dependency.
Don't set BUILD_DEPENDS to RUN_DEPENDS; it's not required to build the
port and speeds up port building significantly.

Remove USE_GROFF.  mandoc handles B<< >> worse than groff though.  Also,
mandoc doesn't wrap URLs.

Changes since version 1.24:
