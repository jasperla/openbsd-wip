The Waf framework supports the major usecases encountered when working on a
software project. It is essentially a library of components that are suitable
for use in a build system, with an emphasis on extensibility. Although the
default distribution contains various plugins for several programming languages
and different tools (c, d, ocaml, java, etc), it is by no means a frozen
product. Creating new extensions is both a standard and a recommended practice.
