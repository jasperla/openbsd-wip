Filename pattern matching library functions for DOS, Windows, and
Unix.

Filename patterns are composed of regular (printable) characters
which may comprise a filename, as well as special pattern matching
characters. A filename patterns is a special kind of regular
expression, except that it is not as general and is designed to
match only file and directory names instead of arbitrary text
strings. The syntax is borrowed from Unix, and is a superset of the
MS-DOS and Windows syntax.
