This is a faster but less expandable version of Class::Accessor.
Class::Accessor's generated accessors require two method calls to
accompish their task (one for the accessor, another for get() or set()).
Class::Accessor::Fast eliminates calling set()/get() and does the access
itself, resulting in a somewhat faster accessor.

The downside is that you can't easily alter the behavior of your
accessors, nor can your subclasses. Of course, should you need this
later, you can always swap out Class::Accessor::Fast for
Class::Accessor.
