This is for CI testing, post-25.03.  The distfile is
a github mirror of the svn project.

----

There is an unresolved missing/extra error with WANTLIB pixman-1:

Missing: pixman-1.40 (/usr/local/lib/libwxsmithlib.so.0.1) (system lib)
Extra:  pixman-1.46
WANTLIB += pixman-1

The WANTLIB is already present, and the build creates pixman-1.40 files,
there are no 1.46 files.
