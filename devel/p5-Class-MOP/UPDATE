Update the test suite since the output of Package::Stash has changed.

p5-Task-Weaken is a build dependency and not a runtime dependency.  Read
Task::Weaken(3p) and grep the source code if you're not convinced.
Don't set BUILD_DEPENDS to RUN_DEPENDS; it's not required to build the
port and speeds up port building significantly.

Remove USE_GROFF.  mandoc handles B<< >> worse than groff though.
