| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Codespeed has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should create a vhost for Codespeed (must be on a subdomain or full domain) 

Vhost example for nginx: 

# codespeed
}

Restart nginx and browse to codespeed.my.domain and follow the setup instructions provided. 

For more information, visit: http://www.phabricator.com/docs/phabricator/article/Configuration_Guide.html

* To get started, you can use the `sample_project` directory as a starting point 
for your Django project, which can be normally configured by editing `sample_project/settings.py`.
* For simplicity, you can use the default sqlite configuration, which will save
  the data to a database named `data.db`
* Create the DB by typing from the root directory:

        python manage.py syncdb

* Create an admin user in the process.
* Migrate to the new DB Schema:

        python manage.py migrate

* For testing purposes, you can now start the development server:

        python manage.py runserver 8000

The codespeed installation can now be accessed by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/`.

**Note**: for production, you should configure a real server like Apache or nginx 
(refer to the [Django docs](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/)).
You should also modify `sample_project/settings.py` and set `DEBUG = False`.

# Codespeed configuration

## Using the provided test data

If you want to test drive Codespeed, you can use the testdata.json fixtures to have a working data set to browse.

* From the root directory, type:

        ./manage.py loaddata codespeed/fixtures/testdata.json

## Starting from scratch

Before you can start saving (and displaying) data, you need to first create an
environment and define a default project.

* Go to `http://localhost:8000/admin/codespeed/environment/`
  and create an environment.
* Go to `http://localhost:8000/admin/codespeed/project/`
  and create a project.

Check the field "Track changes" and, in case you want version control
integration, configure the relevant fields.

**Note**: Only executables associated to projects with a checked "track changes"
field will be shown in the Changes and Timeline views.

# Saving data

Data is saved POSTing to `http://localhost:8000/result/add/`.

You can use the script `tools/save_single_result.py` as a guide.
When saving large quantities of data, it is recommended to use the JSON API instead:
    `http://localhost:8000/result/add/json/`

An example script is located at `tools/save_multiple_results.py`

**Note**: If the given executable, benchmark, project, or
revision do not yet exist, they will be automatically created, together with the
actual result entry. The only model which won't be created automatically is the
environment. It must always exist or the data won't be saved (that is the reason
it is described as a necessary step in the previous "Codespeed configuration"
section).
