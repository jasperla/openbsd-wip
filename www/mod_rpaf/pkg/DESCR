mod_rpaf is for backend Apache servers. It changes the remote address of 
the client visible to other Apache modules when two conditions are 
satisfied. First condition is that the remote client is actually a proxy 
that is defined in httpd.conf. Secondly if there is an incoming 
X-Forwarded-For header and the proxy is in it's list of known proxies it 
takes the last IP from the incoming X-Forwarded-For header and changes 
the remote address of the client in the request structure. It also takes 
the incoming X-Host header and updates the virtualhost settings accordingly.
