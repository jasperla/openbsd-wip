YaCy is a free search engine that anyone can use to build a search portal
for their intranet or to help search the public internet. When contributing
to the world-wide peer network, the scale of YaCy is limited only by the
number of users in the world and can index billions of web pages. It is
fully decentralized, all users of the search engine network are equal, the
network does not store user search requests and it is not possible for
anyone to censor the content of the shared index. We want to achieve freedom
of information through a free, distributed web search which is powered by
the world's users.
