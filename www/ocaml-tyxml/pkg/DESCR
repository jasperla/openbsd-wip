TyXML allows you to build XML trees whose validity is ensured by the
typechecker. It's based on a traduction of XML types into
polymorphic variants, originally written by Thorsten Ohl. Currently,
the transcription has been done for XHTML 1.0 and 1.1, HTML5 and SVG
(partial).

TyXML also provides a generic printer and some low-level (and
untyped) iterators over XML trees. The printer has options for
printing XHTML in more browser-friendly way when served as
"text/html" (instead of "text/xml"). HTML5 is always printed with
those options.

All modules provided by TyXML are also provided in functorial
interface, where every module is parameterised by the underlying XML
representation.

A camlp4 extension, named <<a_api | module Pa_tyxml >>, allows to
write HTML pages or HTML fragments with the usual syntax. For
creating HTML5-, XHTML-, or SVG-nodes, the syntax extension relies
on the presence of a module called ##Html5##, ##Xhtml##, or ##Svg##
which keeps the actual implementation, e.g.

let module Html5 = Eliom_content.Html5.F in <:html5<
<div>xyz</div> >>
