Tornado is an open source version of the scalable, non-blocking web
server and tools.
The framework is distinct from most mainstream web server frameworks
(and certainly most Python frameworks) because it is non-blocking and
reasonably fast. Because it is non-blocking and uses epoll or kqueue, it
can handle thousands of simultaneous standing connections, which means
it is ideal for real-time web services.
