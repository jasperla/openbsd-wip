| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Feng Office has been installed into ${INSTDIR}.

- link Feng Office directory to web-server DocumentRoot

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:

        ln -s ../fengoffice /var/www/htdocs/fengoffice

- make sure you can connect to your database.

In order to run with standard OpenBSD chroot'ed httpd, create a
directory for the mysql socket and adjust permissions:

        install -d -g _mysql -o _mysql /var/www/var/run/mysql

Adjust ${SYSCONFDIR}/my.cnf to put the mysql socket into the chroot.

        [client] socket = /var/www/var/run/mysql/mysql.sock

        [mysqld] socket = /var/www/var/run/mysql/mysql.sock

Don't forget to set the character set to utf8 in your database.

In mysql, assuming you're connected as admin initially.

        create user fengoffice@localhost identified by 'password';
        create database fengoffice character set utf8;
	grant all on fengoffice.* to fengoffice@localhost;

- finish the installation via web

Direct your browser to the http://<localhost>/fengoffice/public/install
and follow the installation procedure.

- (optional) tune funcionality of Feng Office

If you are going to use mail feature, then you probably need DNS working
inside chroot. Copying /etc/resolv.conf into web-server chroot solves
the problem.

        install -d -g daemon -o root /var/www/etc
	install -g bin -o root -m644 /etc/resolv.conf \
		/var/www/etc/resolv.conf

Some functionality may require further configuration, like setting up a
cron job. You can use following on OpenBSD.

        ftp -o - -r 5 http://<localhost>/fengoffice/cron.php
