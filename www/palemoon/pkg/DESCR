Pale Moon is an Open Source, Goanna-based web browser, focusing on
efficiency and ease of use.

Pale Moon offers you a browsing experience in a browser completely built
from its own, independently developed source that has been forked off
from Firefox/Mozilla code a number of years ago, with carefully selected
features and optimizations to improve the browser's stability and user
experience, while offering full customization and a growing collection
of extensions and themes to make the browser truly your own.
