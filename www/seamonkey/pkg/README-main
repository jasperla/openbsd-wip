| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To disable anti-aliasing (xft) set GDK_USE_XFT=0 in the environment.

Plugins
=======
Seamonkey looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins and
${LOCALBASE}/lib/mozilla-plugins.
If the environment variable MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH is specified, this
location will be overridden.

Internationalization
====================
This package contains internationalizations for all supported
languages.  To configure Seamonkey for your language, go to
Edit->Preferences->Appearance->Languages/Content and select your
favorite Language/Content pack.

Debugging
=========
If you encounter crashes, you might want to build the debug FLAVOR of
this package, and run 'seamonkey -g' to run seamonkey inside gdb, so
that you can gather debugging logs and traces.
Bug reports without that information will be ignored.
