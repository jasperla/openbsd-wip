bsnes is a Super Nintendo/Super Famicom emulator that focuses on
performance, features, and ease of use.

bsnes currently enjoys 100% known, bug-free compatibility with the entire
SNES library when configured to its most accurate settings, giving it the
same accuracy level as higan. Accuracy can also optionally be traded for
performance, allowing bsnes to operate more than 300% faster than higan
while still remaining almost as accurate.
