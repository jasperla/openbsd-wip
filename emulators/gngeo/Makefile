# Licensing:  This determines what we can distribute.
# When you determine the license type, make sure to look at ALL distfiles.

# determined by the most restrictive license.  If you have two licenses
# that are in conflict, set PERMIT_* based on the most restrictive one.
# Make SURE you get these values right.

# Put a comment there to state what's going on.
# Can be as brief as `BSD' or `GPLv2', but it'd better be easy to check,
