software designed for IBM PC systems and compatibles from 1981 through
fairly recent system designs based on the PCI bus.

Features:

- Easy to use interface inspired by mainstream hypervisor software
- Low level emulation of 8086-based processors up to the Pentium with
  focus on accuracy
- Great range of customizability of virtual machines
- Many available systems, such as the very first IBM PC 5150 from 1981,
  or the more obscure IBM PS/2 line of systems based on the Micro Channel
  Architecture
- Lots of supported peripherals including video adapters, sound cards,
  network adapters, hard disk controllers, and SCSI adapters
- MIDI output to Windows built-in MIDI support, FluidSynth, or emulated
  Roland synthesizers

  distributions, or vintage systems such as BeOS or NEXTSTEP, and
  applications for these systems
