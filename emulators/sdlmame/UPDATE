This is a WIP update to the latest version of MAME (0.174). Since
version 0.172, MAME is now GPLv2+ licensed [1], which means binary
packages could be built and distributed again.

Upstream switched build systems and now uses Genie [2]. Some blocks
were missing to be able to build on OpenBSD. The patches I sent
upstream have been accepted, so 0.174 starts building without any
patches.

MAME now requires C++14 so port has been updated to use MODGCC4,
however some required stuff seems to be missing from our libraries
so it currently doesn't build, see ERROR file for the log.
