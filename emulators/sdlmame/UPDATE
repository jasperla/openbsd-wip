This is a WIP update to the latest version of MAME (0.173). Since
version 0.172, MAME is now GPLv2+ licensed [1], which means binary
packages could be built and distributed again.

Upstream switched build systems and now uses Genie [2]. Some blocks
were missing to be able to build on OpenBSD, they are implemented in
the patches, which have been sent upstream and accepted, they can
be dropped as soon as 0.174 is released.

MAME now requires C++14 so port has been updated to use MODGCC4,
however some required stuff seems to be missing from our libraries
so it currently doesn't build, see ERROR file for the log.
