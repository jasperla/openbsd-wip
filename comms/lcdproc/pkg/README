| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Typical Usage
=============

 * Edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/LCDd.conf:
   You will need to choose a driver and review your driver options.

 * Start LCDd:
   # ${RCDIR}/lcdd start

 * Review ${SYSCONFDIR}/lcdproc.conf

 * Start the lcdproc client:
   # ${RCDIR}/lcdproc start

Your LCD display should now be displaying system statistics.

The default config file shipped with the OpenBSD package will log any
errors to syslog.

Using the Curses Output
=======================

LCDproc provides a curses output driver which is useful for testing.
When using this driver, you should *not* run LCDd using the bundled rc
script.

Instead, choose the "curses" driver in ${SYSCONFDIR}/LCDd.conf and run:
   LCDd -f

Miscellaneous Notes
===================

 * Network statistics are not yet supported on OpenBSD.
