DVB-T dongles based on the Realtek RTL2832U can be used as a cheap SDR
(software defined radio), since the chip allows transferring the raw I/Q
samples to the host, which is officially used for DAB/DAB+/FM demodulation.

RTL-SDR provides some tools to work with these devices:

rtl_eeprom:	EEPROM programming tool
rtl_fm:		general purpose analogue demodulator
		(narrow band FM, wide band FM, AM and SSB)
rtl_power:	simple FFT logger
rtl_sdr:	tunes the device and captures raw data to a file
rtl_test:	check the possible tuning range

Some tools from the RTL-SDR distribution require asynchronous mode; this
is not supported by libusb1 on OpenBSD with the ugen(4) backend used here.
rtl_fm has been modified to use synchronous mode; rtl_adsb and rtl_tcp
have not so are unavailable.
