scrcpy provides display and control of Android devices connected to USB
or TCP/IP. It does not require any root access on the phone.

It focuses on:

 - lightness (native, displays only the device screen)
 - performance (30~60fps)
 - quality (1920x1080 or above)
 - low latency (35~70ms)
 - low startup time (~1 second to display the first image)
 - non-intrusiveness (nothing is left installed on the device)
