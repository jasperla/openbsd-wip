Python-adb is a pure-python implementation of the ADB and Fastboot protocols,
using libusb1 for USB communications.

This is a complete replacement and rearchitecture of the Android project's ADB
and fastboot code

This code is mainly targeted to users that need to communicate with Android
devices in an automated fashion, such as in automated testing. It does not have
a daemon between the client and the device, and therefore does not support
multiple simultaneous commands to the same device. It does support any number of
devices and never communicates with a device that it wasn't intended to, unlike
the Android project's ADB.
