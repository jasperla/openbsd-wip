Running doctools binaries
=========================
The Heirloom doctools consist of many small binaries intimately tied
together, most of them conflicting with groff. To avoid runtime
conflicts, you may wish to prefer Heirloom binaries by prepending
${TRUEPREFIX}/heirloom-doctools/bin to your PATH.

Reading doctools manual pages
=============================
Adding the heirloom-doctools/man directory to man.conf(5) only makes
sense if you do *not* intend to use the groff package in parallel;
otherwise, just set

export MANPATH=${TRUEPREFIX}/heirloom-doctools/man:

in the shell where you want to read Heirloom manuals. Note the trailing
colon.
