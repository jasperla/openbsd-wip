The Heirloom Documentation Tools package provides troff, nroff, and
related utilities to format manual pages and other documents for output
on terminals and printers. They are portable and enhanced versions of
the utilities released by Sun as part of OpenSolaris, which are a
variant of ditroff, which, in turn, descends to the historical Unix
troff that generated output for the C/A/T phototypesetter.
