Slic3r takes 3D models (STL, OBJ, AMF) and converts them into G-code
instructions for 3D printers. It's compatible with any modern printer based on
the RepRap toolchain, including all those based on the Marlin, Sprinter and
Repetier firmware. It also works with Mach3, LinuxCNC and Machinekit
controllers.

Key features are:

* **multi-platform** (Linux/Mac/Win) and packaged as standalone-app with no
  dependencies required
* complete **command-line interface** to use it with no GUI
* multi-material **(multiple extruders)** object printing
* multiple G-code flavors supported (RepRap, Makerbot, Mach3, Machinekit etc.)
* ability to plate **multiple objects having distinct print settings**
* **multithread** processing
* **STL auto-repair** (tolerance for broken models)
* wide automated unit testing

Other major features are:

* combine infill every 'n' perimeters layer to speed up printing
* **3D preview** (including multi-material files)
* **multiple layer heights** in a single print
* **spiral vase** mode for bumpless vases
* fine-grained configuration of speed, acceleration, extrusion width
* several infill patterns including honeycomb, spirals, Hilbert curves
* support material, raft, brim, skirt
* **standby temperature** and automatic wiping for multi-extruder printing
* customizable **G-code macros** and output filename with variable placeholders
* support for **post-processing scripts**
* **cooling logic** controlling fan speed and dynamic print speed
