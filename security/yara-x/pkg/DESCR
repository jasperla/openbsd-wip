YARA-X is a re-incarnation of YARA, a pattern matching tool designed with
malware researchers in mind. This new incarnation intends to be faster, safer
and more user-friendly than its predecessor. The ultimate goal of YARA-X is to
serve as the future replacement for YARA.

With YARA-X you can create descriptions of malware families (or whatever you
want to describe) based on textual or binary patterns. Each description (a.k.a.
rule) consists of a set of patterns and a boolean expression which determine its
logic.
