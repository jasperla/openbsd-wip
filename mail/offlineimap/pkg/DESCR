OfflineIMAP is  a  tool  to   simplify   your   e-mail  reading.   With
OfflineIMAP,  you  can  read  the same mailbox from multiple computers.
You get a current copy of your messages on each computer,  and  changes
you make one place will be visible on all other systems.  For instance,
you can delete a message on your home  computer,  and  it  will  appear
deleted  on  your work computer as well.  OfflineIMAP is also useful if
you want to use a mail reader that does not have IMAP support, has poor
IMAP support, or does not provide disconnected operation.

OfflineIMAP is FAST; it synchronizes my two accounts with over 50 fold-
ers in 3 seconds.  Other similar tools might take over  a  minute,  and
achieve  a  less-reliable  result.   Some mail readers can take over 10
minutes to do the same thing, and some don't even support  it  at  all.
Unlike other mail tools, OfflineIMAP features a multi-threaded synchro-
nization algorithm that can dramatically speed up performance  in  many
situations by synchronizing several different things simultaneously.

OfflineIMAP is FLEXIBLE; you can customize which folders are synced via
regular expressions, lists, or Python expressions; a versatile and com-
prehensive  configuration  file  is  used to control behavior; two user
interfaces are built-in; fine-tuning of synchronization performance  is
possible; internal or external automation is supported; SSL and PREAUTH
tunnels are both supported; offline (or "unplugged")  reading  is  sup-
ported;  and esoteric IMAP features are supported to ensure compatibil-
ity with the widest variety of IMAP servers.
