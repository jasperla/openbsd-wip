Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to the
one of gzip or bzip2. Lzip decompresses almost as fast as gzip and
compresses more than bzip2, which makes it well suited for software
distribution and data archiving.

Lzip is a clean implementation of the LZMA algorithm. The lzip file
format is designed for long-term data archiving. It is clean, provides
very safe 4 factor integrity checking. Lzip uses the same well-defined
exit status values used by bzip2, which makes it safer when used in
pipes or scripts than compressors returning ambiguous warning values,
like gzip.

This package contains lunzip, decompressor for lzip files written in C.
