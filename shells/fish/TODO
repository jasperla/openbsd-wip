Lots of errors/warnings surrounding each command invocation:

fish: Unknown command 'prompt_pwd'
/usr/local/share/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish (line 6): prompt_pwd

fish: Unknown command '__fish_pwd'
Standard input: echo $_ " "; __fish_pwd


"make test" seems to gobble up a ton of memory.


Manpages need checking against mandoc/groff.
