| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To play iortcw on OpenBSD, you need the original game files.
Copy the game data to ~/.wolf/main/ folder.


Macppc specifics
================

Additional configuration may be required, as noted below.

OpenGL renderer
---------------

The opengl2 renderer is not available on many of the supported graphics cards
and will prevent iortcw from starting with the default configuration.
Specifiying seta cl_renderer "opengl1" in the config file will allow use of the
opengl1 renderer.

16-bit textures 
---------------

Graphical issues occur when using 16-bit textures on the Radeon 9200, 9600, and
9700. 32-bit textures should be used if this happens.

Radeon 9700
-----------

Weapons and fonts will not appear without specifying seta r_hdr "0" in the
config file. The Radeon 9200 and 9600 do not have this issue.

Extensions should also be turned off by specifying seta r_allowExtensions "0"
in the config file.

Radeon 9200
-----------

Fullscreen requires the X11 resolution to match the one specified in the
iortcw config file. This has been tested in FVWM and Window Maker, and only
Window Maker displays fullscreen correctly out of the 2.

The fastest graphics preset should be used in iortcw. Resolution can then be
modified from there for a playable game.

The main menu in iortcw has poor performance that other parts of the game do
not suffer from.
