You are a lone outsider in a strange, non-Euclidean world. You can move
with the numpad, vi keys (hjklyubn), or mouse. You can also skip turns
by pressing ".".

As a Rogue, your goal is to collect as many treasures as possible.
However, collecting treasures attracts dangerous monsters (on the other
hand, killing the monsters allows more treasures to be generated).

You can kill most monsters by moving into them. Similarly, if the
monster was next to you at the end of your turn, it would kill you. The
game protects you from getting yourself killed accidentally by ignoring
moves which lead to instant death (similar to the check rule from
Chess).

Collecting enough treasure also allows you to find rare magical orbs,
which grant you one-time or time-limited special abilities.
