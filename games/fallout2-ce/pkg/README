| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD

This port needs windows game assets, use steamctl or grab your copy from
GOG.com

Just cd to your "Fallout 2" directory and run `fallout2-ce` to use this.

Game configs can be made using the f2_res.ini and the fallout2.cfg files in root
of the game assets directory, though sometimes stability can be impacted by
modifying these files heavily.
