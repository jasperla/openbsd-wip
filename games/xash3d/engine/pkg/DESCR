Xash3d is a custom Gold Source engine rewritten from scratch.  It is
compatible with many of the Gold Source games and mods and should be
able to run almost any existing singleplayer Half-Life mod without a
hitch.  Multiplayer on LAN or Internet games is availble.  The multi-
player part is not yet completed.
