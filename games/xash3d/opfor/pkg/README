Installing Game Data
--------------------

To play Half-Life: Opposing Force, you must have a copy of your `gearbox'
directory from Steam.  You must have write access to this directory as
well, as the game will write configuration and save files to these locations.

It is unknown if Half-Life: Opposing Force data from the original CD release
will work or not.

Half-Life: Opposing Force is available for purchase on Steam.  To fetch your
game data, utilize the `games/depotdownloader' package.

Add a link to your game data as follows:

  $ cd ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/xash3d
  $ doas ln -s ~/games/steamdepots/Half-Life:_Opposing_Force/gearbox

Xash3d requires some extra assets for the menus to work correctly.  This file
can be fetched manually, and placed in the `gearbox' directory:

  $ ftp -o ~/games/steamdepots/Half-Life:_Opposing_Force/gearbox/extras.pak \
	https://github.com/FWGS/xash-extras/releases/download/v0.19.2/extras.pak

The game can now be started with the `opposingforce' script.
