Installing Game Data
--------------------

To play Half-Life: Blue Shift, you must have a copy of your `bshift' directory
from Steam.  You must have write access to this directory as well, as the game
will write configuration and save files to these locations.

It is unknown if Half-Life: Blue Shift data from the original CD release will
work or not.

Half-Life: Blue Shift is available for purchase on Steam.  To fetch your game
data, utilize the `games/depotdownloader' package.

Add a link to your game data as follows:

  $ cd ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/xash3d
  $ doas ln -s ~/games/steamdepots/Half-Life:_Blue_Shift/bshift

The game can now be started with the `blueshift' script.
