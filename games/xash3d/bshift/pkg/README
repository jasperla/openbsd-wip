Installing Game Data
--------------------

To play Half-Life: Blue Shift, you must have a copy of your `bshift' directory
from Steam.  You must have write access to this directory as well, as the game
will write configuration and save files to these locations.

It is unknown if Half-Life: Blue Shift data from the original CD release will
work or not.

Half-Life: Blue Shift is available for purchase on Steam.  To fetch your game
data, utilize the `games/depotdownloader' package.

Add a link to your game data as follows:

  $ cd ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/xash3d
  $ doas ln -s ~/games/steamdepots/Half-Life:_Blue_Shift/bshift

Xash3d requires some extra assets for the menus to work correctly.  This file
can be fetched manually, and placed in the `bshift' directory:

  $ ftp -o ~/games/steamdepots/Half-Life:_Blue_Shift/bshift/extras.pak \
	https://github.com/FWGS/xash-extras/releases/download/v0.19.2/extras.pak

The game can now be started with the `blueshift' script.
