RBDoom3BFG 3 is a Doom 3 BFG GPL source modification. The goal 
of RBDoom3BFG 3 is to bring Doom 3 BFG with the help of SDL to
all suitable platforms. Bugs present in the original DOOM 3 will
be fixed (when identified) without altering the original game-play.

Note, to play the original game, you'll need a copy of the game data.

The package can also be used with free map data, like the demomap 
from OpenTechBFG.
