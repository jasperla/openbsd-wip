KeeperRL is a Dungeon Keeper and Dwarf Fortress inspired dungeon
sumulator build on top of roguelike mechanics. You become a Sauron-like
character, searching for ultimate knowledge of destruction. What makes
the game different from other RTS games is that you can, and are
encouraged to, control your main character and lead your minions to an
open war. The characters use equipment, scrolls, potions, spells, and
other things you would expect in a roguelike. Combat is turn-based and
very tactical. The whole world is procedurally generated, and there is
an adventure mode too.
