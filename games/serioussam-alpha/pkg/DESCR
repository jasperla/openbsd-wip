Serious Sam Alpha is the period where Serious Sam was supposed to be a much
bigger game than it turned out to be. Generally, this period is between the
development of In the Flesh (1996) and Test 1 (2000).

After egipet  the player would travel into 6 different planets: the Water
Planet, Lava Planet, Green Planet, Ice Planet, Tropic Planet, and Rock
Planet. After completing all the planets, the player would be in a level
called Space Crusader,

The "early build" of the game was made in early 1998. In the summer of 2013,
people from SeriousSite.ru sent an email to Croteam asking for a pre-release
version of "Serious Sam". Luckily, Roman Ribaric agreed to the request
and shared the old version with the consent of the other members of the
Croteam team.
