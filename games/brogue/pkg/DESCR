Brogue is a graphical Roguelike game.

Your goal is to travel to the 26th subterranean floor of the dungeon,
retrieve the Amulet of Yendor and return with it to the surface. For
the truly skillful who desire further challenge, depths below 26
contain three lumenstones each, items which confer an increased score
upon victory.
