Speed and movement is what Warsow is all about.

Like a true cyberathlete you jump, dash, dodge, and walljump your way through
the game. Grab power-ups before your enemy does, plant a bomb before anyone sees
you, and steal the enemy's flag before they know what is going on!

Our goal is to offer a fast and fun competitive first-person shooter without
hard graphical violence - Warsow has no blood or guts flying around. Red circles
instead of blood indicate hits and colored triangles replace guts as gib
effects.

We put a great emphasis on extreme customazibility and e-sports features.
