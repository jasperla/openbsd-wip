QuakeSpasm is a *Nix friendly Quake Engine based on the SDL port of the
popular FitzQuake. It includes some new features, important fixes, and
aims for portability and 64 bit correctness.

To run QuakeSpasm you must have the original quake datafiles from one of
the original CD releases or obtained from the Steam or GOG online stores.

For the base game copy the "id1" directory to
${TRUEPREFIX}/share/quakespasm/id1

The mission pack directories "rogue" and "hipnotic" can also be copied
into place and run by specifying the -game <dirname>, ie

quakespasm -game hipnotic
