Cosmo-engine is a new game engine to play the MS-DOS game "Cosmo's
Cosmic Adventure" on modern systems. Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure is a
side-scrolling platform game similar in style to the Commander Keen
series. The player controls Cosmo, a little alien boy trying to go to
Disney World with his parents for his birthday.

While this package and the game engine are open source, one still needs
to provide the original game assets from Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure, which
is not open source. You will need to purchase the original game to use
this package.
