We are rewriting its engine in C++11 from scratch (GPLv3+). Including
"modern" technologies like OpenGL and GLSL, we aim to create an exact
clone (for now), using the original media files. This allows people
using GNU/Linux to play the game natively, minus features, plus
additional epic bugs (or was it vice versa?).
