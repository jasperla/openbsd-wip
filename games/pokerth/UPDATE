This WIP port is for integration testing post 2025.09.04

This test client will NOT connect to the public Internet server as a 
human player, as authentication has changed.  It can connect
successfully as a guest.

There is a private test server available for coordinated ranking 
games.  I have connected to it, though the next ranking game test is
not yet scheduled.

---

The included dedicated_server can be run as a CI test-only target,
it requires being executed from the top of the source tree:
see docs/server_setup_howto.txt.

The last commit capable of connecting to the official 1.1.2
server for internet games (as a human player) is currently
maintained as a separate branch: last-client-for-112-server.
