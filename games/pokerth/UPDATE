This WIP port is for integration testing post 2025.09.04

This is currently building as a version 1.1.2 patch level,
though upstream has its internal version set to 2.0.  I
will move from 1.1.2 package naming once upstream tags 2.0
as ready for beta testing. This avoids package update issues.

This test client will NOT connect to the public Internet server as a 
human player, as authentication has changed.  It can connect
successfully as a guest.

The dedicated_server can be run as a CI test-only target,
it requires being executed from the top of the source tree:
see docs/server_setup_howto.txt.

The last commit capable of connecting to the official 1.1.2
server for internet games (as a human player) is currently
maintained as a separate branch: last-client-for-112-server.
