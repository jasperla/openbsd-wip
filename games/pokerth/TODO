Continued testing and tweaks.  

* this is a fork of pokerth, in order to backlevel websocketpp for boost.

* patches for CMakeList.txt: remove mysqlpp libraries, required by the 
  unused server, and remove full path names for install directories.

* patch for games_def.h: call this "1.1.2-obsd" -- upstream still hasn't
  changed the version from 1.1.2 for their -stable branch.
