Continued testing and tweaks.  

This is a fork of pokerth, in order to backlevel websocketpp for boost.

Patch for CMakeList.txt: remove unused mysqlpp libraries reference,
only used with pokerth_server

Patch for games_def.h: call this fork version "1.1.2-obsd" -- upstream
still hasn't changed the version from 1.1.2 for their -stable branch.
