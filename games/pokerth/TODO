Continued testing and tweaks.  

* this is a fork of pokerth, in order to backlevel websocketpp for boost.

* patches for CMakeList.txt: remove unused mysqlpp libraries reference,
  and use relative path names for install directories.
  (path name change submitted upstream as a PR)

* patch for games_def.h: call this "1.1.2-obsd" -- upstream still hasn't
  changed the version from 1.1.2 for their -stable branch.
