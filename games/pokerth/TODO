builds and runs.  Testing started.  Not pleased with
8000+ lines of patches; might fork just to simplify
the port.

Testing generally works, there are some warnings produced, such as:

"Could not create pixmap from /usr/local/share/pokerth/data/gfx/gui/table/danuxi1/NULL"

There is no "NULL" file in that directory.
