A `spear' executable has been installed to play the game. You will need
your registered version of the Spear of Destiny data files to play the
game. The executable must be run within the directory that the data
files are stored in, as the game must have write permission to the data
files directory.

The data files must be the full registered version and/or the mission
sets.
