Wolf4SDL is a portable version of id Software's Spear of Destiny. The
actual gameplay has been retained to feel just like the original, with
minimal added features. The OPL2 emulator from MAME has been implimented
to supply perfect playback of the original adlib sounds, so you can
play and hear all the sounds and music as if you had a top of the line
machine in 1992 with all the right hardware. Original data files from
the original game are required, the following version:

Spear of Destiny Full and Mission Disks

is required to play. the data files do need to be readable and writable
by the user that wants to play, and the user should run the game while
inside the directory that contains the data files. The game writes to
the config.sod file, and will also output the savegamx.sod files for
each savegame to the current directory. NOTE: there is a copy
protection quiz when you start this game, it requires you have your
original game manual handy to pass the quiz. If you have misplaced the
manual you may either guess, or start the game as follows:

$ spear --goodtimes
