The Zod Engine is an open source remake of the 1996 game Z by the Bitmap
Brothers written in C++ using the SDL library.

The Zod Engine is a MMORTS / RTS style game. In the game you command an
army of robots and vehicles to take over neighboring territories in the
ultimate goal of destroying all of your enemies. Unlike traditional RTS
(Real Time Strategy) games the Zod Engine does not create units from
collected resources but instead construction is constant from preset
factories scattered throughout the level.
