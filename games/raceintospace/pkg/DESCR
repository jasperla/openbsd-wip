Race into Space is the free software version of Interplay's Buzz
Aldrin's Race into Space. This is the reworked version following the
source release for the computer version of the Liftoff! board game by
Fritz Bronner. This was developed by Strategic Visions and published by
Interplay as a disk-based game in 1992 and a CD-ROM in 1994.
