Acquiring Game Data
===================

To play this game, one must have a valid Doom64 cartridge from the Nintendo 64
game console, and a cartridge copier.  Using the cartridge copier, create a
ROM dump of the cart.

Once this is completed, you can run the doom64ex binary as follows:

  doom64ex -wadgen /path/to/doom64.rom

This will automatically create a `doom64.wad' file and a doomsnd.sf2 soundfont
file, placing them in the ~/.local/share/doom64ex/ directory.

After this step is complete, run the game as normal.
