Cage is a kiosk compositor for Wayland. A kiosk is a window manager 
(in the X11 world) or compositor (in the Wayland world) that is 
designed for a user experience wherein user interaction and activities 
outside the scope of the running application are prevented. That is, 
a kiosk compositor displays a single maximized application at a time 
and prevents the user from interacting with anything but this application.

As such, user input such as moving, resizing, minimizing and unmaximizing 
windows is ignored. Cage supports dialogs, although they too cannot be 
resized nor moved. Instead, dialogs are centered on the screen. 
Note that multiple maximized windows are supported, but the user is not 
able to cycle between them. That is, if Cage is launched with a terminal 
emulator and an application is launched from this terminal emulator, 
that application is on  of the terminal emulator and takes all input 
until it is closed. When this application is closed, the terminal 
emulator becomes visible again.  When the last application window is closed, 
Cage closes as well.

Cage supports multiple outputs. It supports hotplugging additional outputs 
and exits when its last output is removed. Cage defaults to the outputs' 
preferred modes and supports (static, i.e. specified on startup) output rotation.
 Cage does not support output layout configuration.

There is no support for virtual workspaces. Input-wise, Cage supports pointer input, 
keyboard input and touch input. Copy and paste works as well, including primary 
selection and with full XWayland support.
