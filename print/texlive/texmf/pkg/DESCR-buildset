TeX Live is an easy way to get up and running with TeX. It provides a
comprehensive TeX system which includes all the major TeX-related
programs, macro packages, and fonts that are free software, including
support for many languages around the world.

This package is designed to be the smallest possible texmf subset that
can build OpenBSD ports.
