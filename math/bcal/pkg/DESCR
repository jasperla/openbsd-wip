bcal (Byte CALculator) is a command-line utility for storage, hardware,
and firmware developers who deal with storage-specific numerical
calculations, expressions, unit conversions, or address calculations
frequently. If you are one and can't calculate the hex address offset
for (512 - 16) MiB immediately, or the value when the 43rd bit of a
64-bit address is set, bcal is for you.

To perform non-storage general purpose calculations, there's a switch to
invoke bc.
