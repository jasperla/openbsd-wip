Threading Linkage for Language Bindings
=======================================

If you require a language binding for a language which does not support
multi-threading (at the moment, that is in-base perl and the default
flavoured tcl package), then you must use the LD_PRELOAD environment
variable to preload libpthread.

Eg. LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libpthread.so.x.x perl some_graphviz_script.pl

This is because a host binary which does not link libpthread may not
dlopen() a shared object which does link libpthread.
