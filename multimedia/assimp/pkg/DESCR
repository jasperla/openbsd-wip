Open Asset Import Library (short name: Assimp) is a portable Open Source
library to import various well-known 3D model formats in a uniform
manner. The most recent version also knows how to export 3d files and is
therefore suitable as a general-purpose 3D model converter.

Assimp aims to provide a full asset conversion pipeline for use in game
engines / realtime rendering systems of any kind, but it is not limited
to this purpose. In the past, it has been used in a wide range of
applications.

Written in C++, it is available under a liberal BSD license. There is a
C API as well as bindings to various other languages, including C#/.net,
Python and D. Assimp loads all input model formats into one
straightforward data structure for further processing. This feature set
is augmented by various post processing tools, including
frequently-needed operations such as computing normal and tangent
vectors.
