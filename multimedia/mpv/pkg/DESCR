mpv is a fork of mplayer2 and MPlayer.  Its option parser was improved
to behave more like other CLI programs, and many option names and
semantics were reworked to make them more intuitive and memorable.
Instead of default GUI it provides a small controller interface that is
triggered by mouse movement.  OpenGL video output is capable of many
features loved by videophiles, such as video scaling with popular high
quality algorithms, color management, and more, as well as of hardware
decoding using VDPAU and VAAPI.
