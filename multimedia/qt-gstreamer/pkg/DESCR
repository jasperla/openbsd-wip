QtGStreamer is a set of libraries providing C++ bindings for GStreamer
with a Qt-style API, plus some helper classes and elements for
integrating GStreamer better in Qt applications. The goal of this
module is to allow easy use of GStreamer for applications targetting
MeeGo Mobile or the KDE desktop.
