FFmpegSource (usually known as FFMS or FFMS2) is a cross-platform wrapper
library around FFmpeg. It gives you an easy, convenient way to say "open and
decompress this media file for me, I don't care how you do it" and get frame-
and sample-accurate access (usually), without having to bother with the
sometimes less than straightforward and less than perfectly documented FFmpeg
API.

The library is written in C++, but the public API is pure C, so if you can link
to a C library, you can use FFMS2. The source is available under the MIT
license, but the license of the binaries depends on how FFmpeg was compiled.
There are optional components that require a GPL FFmpeg, and if those are
compiled in FFMS2 itself becomes covered by the GPL as well.
