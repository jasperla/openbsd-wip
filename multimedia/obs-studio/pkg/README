Live media input
================

The Linux-orientated direct V4L2 input source plugin has not yet been ported,
but video can be captured using FFmpeg.

Set permissions/ownership on /dev/video0 so that the user running OBS
has access to it. One option is to "chown $USER /dev/video0"; when using xenodm
this may be automated via the /etc/X11/xenodm/{Give,Take}Console scripts.

Then in OBS you can add a "Media Source". In the source's settings page, untick
"local file", and enter the following:

Input:		/dev/video0
Source format:	video4linux2
