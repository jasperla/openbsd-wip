* Audio input

linux-pulseaudio builds, but fails unless you "pulseaudio --start" first,
even then doesn't allow device selection when pulse input is used as source,
and doesn't seem to actually record anything whether pulse's input or output 
is used as a source. 
 
linux-jack builds, I've patched to autostart the daemon (which I think is
expected for JACK clients anyway), but doesn't allow device selection, and
doesn't seem able to record anything.

Rather than spending time working on these, hacking on a sndio plugin
would be a better approach, the plugin system is nicely modular so there
shouldn't too much of a battle with infrastructure.

* Video input

Available via ffmpeg (see pkg/README). The linux-v4l2 should be able to
work with multimedia/libv4l but as usual with V4L2 applications it will
require various patching to work with OpenBSD.
