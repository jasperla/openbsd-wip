To create video files for the Sansa Fuze (without using the official the
official "Sansa Media Converter", which is Windows-only, produces files
with bad A/V sync, and is a bit annoying), the video has to be
transcoded to mpeg-4 part 2 video and mp3 audio, with specific codec
settings, frame rate, resolution etc.

The purpose of fuzemux is therefore to remux avi files into the exact
container format required for playing them on the Fuze.
