PhotoFlare is an effort to bring quick, simple but powerful image
editing to the masses. PhotoFlare is inspired by the image editor
currently only available on Microsoft Windows, PhotoFiltre. However, it
will not be a straight clone. It is being built from the ground up to be
much improved and cross platform too!
