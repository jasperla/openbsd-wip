Draco is a library for compressing and decompressing 3D geometric meshes and
point clouds. It is intended to improve the storage and transmission of 3D
graphics.

Draco was designed and built for compression efficiency and speed. The code
supports compressing points, connectivity information, texture coordinates,
color information, normals, and any other generic attributes associated with
geometry. With Draco, applications using 3D graphics can be significantly
smaller without compromising visual fidelity. For users, this means apps can
now be downloaded faster, 3D graphics in the browser can load quicker, and
VR and AR scenes can now be transmitted with a fraction of the bandwidth and
rendered quickly.
