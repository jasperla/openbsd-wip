YAGF is a graphical interface for cuneiform and tesseract text
recognition tools on the Linux platform. With YAGF you can scan
images via XSane, import pages from PDF documents, perform images
preprocessing and recognize texts using cuneiform from a single
command centre. YAGF also makes it easy to scan and recognize several
images sequentially.
