The RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a powerful command line driven
package management system capable of installing, uninstalling,
verifying, querying, and updating software packages. Each software
package consists of an archive of files along with information about
the package like its version, a description, etc.

The purpose of having rpm available as an OpenBSD port is to make
life easy for Linux developers who happen to be using an OpenBSD
system and to make it easy to examine RPM packages from an OpenBSD
system.  Do not consider rpm a replacement for the ports system.

The package database is set to /var/db/rpm by default, to conform
with hier(7).
