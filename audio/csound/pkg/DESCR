Csound is a sound and music computing system which was originally developed by
Barry Vercoe in 1985 at MIT Media Lab. Since the 90s, it has been developed by
a group of core developers. A wider community of volunteers contribute
examples, documentation, articles, and takes part in the Csound development
with bug reports, feature requests and discussions with the core development
team.
