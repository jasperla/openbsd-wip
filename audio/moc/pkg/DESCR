MOC (music on console) is a console audio player for LINUX/UNIX designed
to be powerful and easy to use.

MOC plays smoothly, regardless of system or I/O load because it uses the
output buffer in a separate thread. It provides gapelss playback because
the next file to be played is precached while the current file is
playing.

Internet streams (Icecast, Shoutcast) are supported. Key mapping can be
fully customized.

Supported file formats are: MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, Musepack (mpc),
Speex, Opus, WAVE, those supported by FFmpeg/LibAV (e.g., WMA,
RealAudio, AAC, MP4), AIFF, AU, SVX, Sphere Nist WAV, IRCAM SF, Creative
VOC, SID, wavpack.

Other features:

  - SNDIO output
  - Simple mixer
  - Color themes
  - Menu searching (playlist or directory) like M-s in Midnight Commander
  - The way MOC creates titles from tags is configurable
  - Optional character set conversion for file tags using iconv()
  - User defined keys
  - Cache for files' tags
