WildMIDI is a simple software midi player which has a core softsynth
library that can be use with other applications.

The WildMIDI library uses Gravis Ultrasound patch files to convert MIDI
files into audio which is then passed back to the calling application.
The library API is designed so that it is easy to include WildMIDI into
applications that wish to include MIDI file playback.
