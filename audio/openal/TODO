- the sndio_available_samples() returns always that data is
  available, but this can't be true, and if no data is available
  (i.e. the second time it's called) sniod_captire_samples() will
  block during one block and prevent the program from progressing,
  in turn causing possible degradation in responsiveness.

  Fixing this would require a thread to be started, and a counter
  indicating the available bytes to be exposed, which requires
  locking and so on.

  The ./playback_mic program doesn't work for small blocks which is
  likely to be related to this problem. For instance, kill sndiod
  and start:

	sudo sndiod -ddd -a on -z 256

  then run ./playback_mic in another window.

- depending on how openal is used, the play end could be improved
  to buffer a single block (which is simpler), which would reduce
  latency at no stability cost. Or possibly multiple blocks
  masquaraded as a signle UpdateSize.

Above points require a lot of testing, as bugs don't crash
programs. They simply affect responsiveness or latency.
