CellWriter is a grid-entry natural handwriting input panel.
Writer-dependent, CellWriter learns your handwriting for reliable
recognition. Correcting preprocessor algorithms account for digitizer
noise, differing stroke order, direction, and number of strokes. Unicode
support enables you to write in any language.
