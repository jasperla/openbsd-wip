The SystemSettings provides the user with a centralized and convenient way to
configure all of the settings for your desktop.

SystemSettings is made up of multiple modules. Each module is a separate
application, however the SystemSettings organizes all of these applications into
a single location.

Each SystemSettings module can be executed individually.
