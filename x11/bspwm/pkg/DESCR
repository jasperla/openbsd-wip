bspwm is a tiling window manager that represents windows as the leaves of a
full binary tree.

It only responds to X events, and the messages it receives on a dedicated
socket.

bspc is a program that writes messages on bspwm's socket.

bspwm doesn't handle any keyboard or pointer inputs: a third party program
(e.g. sxhkd) is needed in order to translate keyboard and pointer events to
bspc invocations.
