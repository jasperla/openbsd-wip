Libmenu-cache is a library creating and utilizing caches to speed
up the manipulation for freedesktop.org defined application menus.
It can be used as a replacement of libgnome-menu of gnome-menus.
 
Advantages:
 1. Shorten time for loading menu entries.
 2. Ease of use. (API is very similar to that of libgnome-menu)
 3. Lightweight runtime library. (Parsing of the menu definition 
    files are done by menu-cache-gen when the menus are really 
    changed.)
 4. Less unnecessary and complicated file monitoring.
 5. Heavily reduced disk I/O.
