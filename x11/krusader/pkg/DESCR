Krusader is an advanced twin panel (commander style) file manager for
KDE similar to Midnight or Total Commander.
It provides all the file management features you could possibly want:
extensive archive handling, mounted filesystem support, FTP, advanced
search module, an internal viewer/editor, directory synchronisation,
file content comparisons, powerful batch renaming and much much more.
It supports a wide variety of archive formats and can handle other KIO
slaves such as smb or fish. It is (almost) completely customizable, very
user friendly and fast.
