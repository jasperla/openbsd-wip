Orthos is a lightweight-but-cool display manager for X11. It provides
workstations with an accelerated graphical login, which doesn't depend on big
libraries (gtk/qt), and is not connected with any specific window manager.

Orthos is meant to be OpenGL-accelerated, and supports skins in the form of
dynamically loaded libraries.
