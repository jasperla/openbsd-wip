GpgME++ is a C++ wrapper (or C++ bindings) for the GnuPG project's gpgme (GnuPG
Made Easy) library, version 0.4.4 and later.

It is fairly complete, with some minor things still missing (in particular, the
key edit interface). It is mostly tested using external event loops, for which
its design is optimised.
