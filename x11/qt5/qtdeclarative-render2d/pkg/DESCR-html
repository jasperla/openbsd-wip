QtQuick2DRenderer is an alternative renderer for Qt Quick 2 that uses the Raster
paint engine to render the contents of the scene graph instead of OpenGL.
As a result of not using OpenGL to render the scene graph, some features and
optimizations are no longer available. Most Qt Quick 2 applications will run
without modification though any attempts to use unsupported features will be
ignored. By using the QtQuick2DRenderer it is now possible to run Qt Quick 2
applications on hardware and platforms that do not have OpenGL support.

This package contains QtQuick2DRenderer HTML documentation.
