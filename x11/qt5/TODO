1. Support for OpenBSD sensors, using dummy sensors for now.
2. V4L2 support (look at the fswebcam for patched videodev2.h?).
3. No HTML docs due to qdoc segfault.
4. The libfftreal and libgruesensor libs ignore overwritten versions.
5. No -debug - yet?
6. COMMENT and DESCR in subpackages could be improved.
7. Check placement of CMake and pkg-config helpers.
