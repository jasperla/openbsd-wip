1. Support for OpenBSD sensors, using dummy sensors for now.
2. V4L2 support (look at the fswebcam for patched videodev2.h?).
3. No HTML docs due to qdoc segfault.
4. No -debug - yet?
5. COMMENT and DESCR in subpackages could be improved.
6. "Unsupported NFC platform, will not build a working QtNfc library".
7. -L/usr/local/* could come before -L${WRKBUILD/* when linking is done
   across Qt module boundaries.
