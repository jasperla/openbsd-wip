StepSync allows keeping two folders synchronized, it can be thus used as
a back-up utility.

StepSync manages two trees, starting from a folder as root and recursing
in them.

StepSync first allows a comparison of source and destination trees.
StepSync determines which files were added or removed or changed (based
on last modification date) as well as addition or deletion of folders.
Then it allows, distinctly, to insert new files, to update or delete. It
allows also to apply changes from target to source.
