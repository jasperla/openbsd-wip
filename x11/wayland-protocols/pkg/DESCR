wayland-protocols contains protocols and protocol extensions
complementing the Wayland core protocol with additional functionality. As
of this release, projects can start to add a build time dependency on
wayland-protocols and use wayland-scanner to generate protocol C API
using the XML protocol files installed by wayland-protocols.
